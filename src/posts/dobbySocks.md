The first time I was a handed a self-help book was 3 years ago; Everything I Know about Love by Dolly Alderton for my 22nd birthday. My auntie had bought it - half to joke and half to encourage me and my comical love life thus far.


The premise of the book, with its patterned backing and encouraging colours, conjured a fire within me to fully reject what I perceived as being the blind leading the blind. I handed it immediately over to my friend who had witnessed me unpack it, and disregard it like some old sock.   


"Too close to the bone" my auntie said. A statement not a question. The witticism amongst my family has never wavered, particularly in relevance to my, or in that matter, any of my cousin's love lives.

I was younger then, and more reckless with my love. Fresh out of university with a freelance role in the big city - the world was my oyster. I halfheartedly downloaded tinder and bumble, as some kind of social experiment but was “never really on tinder” - the only date set up with a man SO boring that it invoked the sympathy of the gentlemen next to us into paying £200 worth of cocktails on their company credit card. 
 
My time spent in London was a series of unfortunate events regarding the love of another. The diary of affections and rejections, complications or embarrassing communications. A brilliant one being when (the same very friend as mentioned above) encouraged me to get chatting to a boy at a party in Peckham. “Want to know a cool fact about me?” he asked. “I live next door to Jeremy Corbyn”. “- Eugh!” I replied “my mum hates him, a misogynistic and privileged old oaf. Too conservative” I could only just make out his odd expression through the darkness and heavy techno “Really? Jeremy Corbyn?” It hit me through the noise and the drugs “oh” I laughed “I was talking about Jeremy Clarkson!”. I don’t remember him finding it funny, but he took my number anyway. 
 
Three years later I have collated similarly’ humorous stories, others sad, some meaningful but without longevity. And then on my 25th birthday I received another book in the post How to Get Over a Boy by Chidera Eggerue. Another one of my auntie’s specials I assumed. Although this time, instead of tossing it into the waste bin or shredding it into a million tiny pieces, I actually read it.  


I read it because I wasn’t afraid to read it, the fear being that I was some millennial tragedy whereby colourful picture books of positive affirmations was the antidote. I read it because I have moved past that initial adolescence fuelled by my arrogance, that being hurt or hurting others is somehow unaffecting. It does affect you, and it chips away at your self-worth. Much in the same way that eating a grubby McDonalds every day of your life would. And if you’re immune to that, maybe you should ask yourself why.  


I read it during a period of deliberate abstinence (that has turned into more of an enforced one thanks to lockdown). And the words spoke me. Aside from the title, which I still wince a bit when saying out loud, this was the first self-reflective moment of my journey in love so far. It caused me to evaluate past decisions, what I put up with, what I let go and what I was going for. All of this driven by a low sense of self-worth, a Raindance of riddled emotions that we have all stripped ourselves for. Because no one is born with self-worth, entitlement is very different, and the journey to loving yourself takes time to build. 


Being selfish, I learned the hard way, is ultimately the most selfless act. No one needs to worry about you or prop you up, other than in the natural moments of life where support from others is needed. 


Last week I picked up Everything I know about Love, three years after initially parting with it. Dolly Alderton speaks from past experiences without shame, exposing her faults and flaws through incredible anecdotes.  


My auntie had never sent me the book on my 25th birthday, and ultimately has no real care of my decisions in the realm of love. It was, in fact, sent to me all the way from Australia, by the very friend that has already been mentioned twice in this story. 


I learned also, The Love Story of which to be proud and held in esteem is between me, and my friends and family that continuously love me. Being grateful and not disregarding what you have already is the first step to self-love. And once you reach a plateau, you realise distinctly how you will never settle – because why would you lessen. Like building the bricks of a house, I’m not going to let some swindler come in last minute and fit an electric system, when it quite clearly runs on gas, and have to start all over again.  


For me, accepting self-help books only happened when I had already eradicated a part of self- loathing. In summary I took it far too seriously back then, and to be seen with a self-help book would be a public declaration or discredit to a perceived self-worth for the whole world to see. The paranoia that “She must be going through some shit” is being thought by the guy in the seat opposite me. Which is made somewhat ironic as I return to these books in a time where actually, I’m not. 


Because since then I have moved away from putting my self-worth into the interactions of others, and instead put it back into my own hands. Not knowing and learning from mistakes isn’t a tragedy, it’s a gift. It’s life. Dolly Alderton made me realise that all these stories, connections and affiliations only build your narrative and are in no way a shaming experience. Because what the fuck do you really know up until 25. 


And now the books I parted with like an old sock, I have reclaimed. And like Dobby the elf I see them as a key to unlocking freedom - a brighter future based on a positive sense of self.
