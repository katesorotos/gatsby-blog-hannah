Now for anyone that knows me well enough, I’m not one for an extensive feminist rant. In fact, over the years I’ve felt a real dissociation from the word. Even ending in quite heated debates with friends and family that I have a problem with “some pink-tutu-dress wearing feminist” telling me how to be one. Equally I don't appreciate articles telling me how I should respond as a feminist. It sucks the humour out of everything, draws in a guise of us and them, and then, as if you couldn’t feel anymore disfranchised by the whole operation, they also want you to buy their merchandise. 


But what's a blog without one, eh? 


Thankfully, some people I can get behind entered the scene. Feminists Don’t Wear Pink and Other Lies was the illustrating point of what I was trying to articulate to anyone who would listen. That I feel there has been a dissociation and disagreement with where we should be going moving forward, not to mention the intersectional failures that favour the white middle class (more buzzwords for you there).

Phoebe Waller-Bridge and her genius creations of Fleabag and Killing Eve made me proud to call myself a feminist once more. Brilliantly scripted, naughty and flawed as well as female protagonists that you don’t appreciate as being protagonists until you really think about. So natural are their positions of power. 


Carolyn Martens, the head of the Russian Desk of MI6 in Killing Eve being my favourite. Just embodying exactly everything of what it is to be a “boss b*tch”, with the art of deflection from belittlement by the predatory male agent after her position. “And, Carolyn... I’m so sorry about the whole office debacle. They told me I had to take yours as it was closer to the apartment.” - “Paul, I don’t even know where my office is.” My favourite line of the 3 series so far.   


And how Villanelle returns the pink-tutu-dresses with power, prowess and shrewd femininity. 


An interesting moment for me was when I was in a comedy club in Berlin; English speaking with a mix of nationalities and genders. The host’s final farewell was to ask any men to put their hand up if they were afraid walking home alone that night, no one so much as twitched. And finally, the women? Every one of us of course raised our arms – although in fairness it was my first night in the city, it was far away from my apartment and I have a hopeless sense of direction. 


I come from a privilege, a matriarchal family. The women in my life are the strong, intelligent, support systems. Both the breadwinners and bread-makers. I’ve never felt like my voice hasn’t been heard, or in anyway disadvantaged by my gender. That was until I began to work professionally. 


In my first job in a restaurant in London the male head chef used to goggle at me and nudge all his kitchen staff into agreeing that I was ‘gorgeous’. I was 19, and he was an overweight married man in his 50s. Sadly, I batted it away as childsplay and I didn’t take offence – the only child here being me.  


Without going into too much detail, in the not too recent past, my male boss asked me if I would consider being a travel companion to one of their high-end clients. A 70-year-old man, in exchange for “champagne” with the promise “I wouldn’t have to do anything”. Furthermore, as the job paid me little, I needed a side gig to help make ends meet, working in a waffle/milkshake bar down the road from me. This was only mentioned to my boss after declining ‘work drinks’ that evening, saying I had work (after work) - where? He asked. Oh nowhere, just a little cash in hand thing - I replied. oh a massage parlour? He implied.

Now, god knows I love a laugh. My ego rarely stops me from finding a joke funny. But nothing about him, his reference or his measly attempt at a “joke” so much as coursed the edges of my mouth to crease. Safe to say my resignation followed a few weeks afterwards. 


Now the reason for my writing this article was thoughts during my run. I’ve really got into it recently during lockdown, using the Couch to 5k app and even creating a playlist (I'll link it at the bottom).


I live in a rural area, there are lots of fields around; I am fortunate to have the space accessible to me and what I'm about to say shouldn’t discount that. However, it seems it is “that time of year again”, which I can only assume is the reason that in the last week the edges of the field have become swarmed with hordes of large “flies”. I say flies loosely as I'm not really sure what they are, and as a country bumpkin I let myself down here. All I know is that there is a lot of them, they work in groups of about a 1000 and they have what looks like the stern of a boat receding out their bottom. 


They’re awful and my runs have become infested by them. It’s the natural cycle of life, and I don’t knock it sir.

However, around me there are plenty of flat roads and opportunities for beautifully scenic workouts. I would dream to be able to step out and change my morning routine up a little, to new distances and destinations.  I even may even have a better chance of beating some of you lot who seem to miraculously make the 5k in 5 minutes – less bumps and less flies I imagine.  


So what’s stopping me you ask? Well, to put it simply, it’s just not safe enough. 


The roads are quiet, quiet enough to find yourself alone on a stretch with maybe one car or passerby for miles. Especially now in the lockdown.  


And before you think this is some sort of melodrama from my part, this comes from having nearly been abducted on the walk home from the bus stop to my house as a school child, had a lorry not turned the corner at the right time. And saved me from what - I still can only assume - may have happened. 


This also comes from someone who has been boxing for years, and is as fit and strong as most of the men I know in my life. The only thing that targets me in this scenario is literally my gender. 


Now I know I look great on a run. Especially when my face turns from pink to a more Violet Beauregard shade of purple - “Violet, you’re turning violet!”. And even more so when I have to slow down a little, unscrew my water flask, and attempt to run and sip with swan like grace as the water mostly misses my mouth and sloshes around my whole face. But Laura, my coach on Couch to 5k, tells me not to stop, no matter what.  


No matter the difficulty from unscrewing my water bottle to sipping and running. No matter the tribes of locusts lining the fields like soldiers at the barracks of some dreadful war who haven’t seen female flesh for too long. No matter the man in the van from when I was 13, patiently waiting for his opportunity to pounce.  


So, for all the men out there who know and love me, and dare I say it, respect my opinion, please do not be fool enough to think we have equal grounds in this. There is still a lot of work to be done.  


And next time you are on your road run, remember this tale and think how fortunate you are that is a safe option for you. And when Many Men by 50 Cent shuffles on my Couch to 5k playlist, think how comical it is that those words should have relevance to us women on our daily runs. 


Because, really, when feminism is boiled down to its basic form - what we are actually asking for is a #runwithoutrape. A worthy cause for any 5k challenge. 

Enjoy the playlist!
